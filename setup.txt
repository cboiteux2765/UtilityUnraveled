I mainly used this website (https://www.nativewind.dev/quick-starts/expo) to set up the project.
My best guess is that not all of the commands need to be run again to set up the app after downloading
the Github repo. If following the instructions listed below does not work, lmk.

Use Node.js v20.13.0 (LTS) (idk if this is important but thats the version I used).

Commands (at least for MacOS):
npm install nativewind
npm install --save-dev tailwindcss@3.3.2
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated

To view the app:
npx expo start

Scan the QR code on your phone.

.gitignore is hiding the folders .expo (is generated when you run npx expo start, comes with a
README.md for more info) and node_modules (huge folder). Might have to run "npm install" to
download node_modules (have not tested this). Try viewing the app before doing that though.
Good luck :)
